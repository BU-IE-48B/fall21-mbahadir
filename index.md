In order to have shorter notebooks, datasets are inspected in different notebooks. In addition, a final result notebook was created to compare achieved results in the 5 different datasets. Namely, Result Notebook includes the best parameter combination and their results for each dataset. General comments can be also found in the Result Notebook.
